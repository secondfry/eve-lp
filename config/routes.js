  // Up until now, we haven't specified a specific HTTP method/verb
  // The routes above will apply to ALL verbs!
  // If you want to set up a route only for one in particular
  // (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.), just specify the verb before the path.
  // For example, if you have a `UserController` with a `signup` action,
  // and somewhere else, you're serving a signup form looks like: 
  //
  //		<form action="/signup">
  //			<input name="username" type="text"/>
  //			<input name="password" type="password"/>
  //			<input type="submit"/>
  //		</form>

  // You would want to define the following route to handle your form:
  'post /signup': 'UserController.signup'


  // What about the ever-popular "vanity URLs" aka URL slugs?
  // (you might remember doing this with `mod_rewrite` in Apache)
  //
  // This is where you want to set up root-relative dynamic routes like:
  // http://yourwebsite.com/twinkletoez
  //
  // NOTE:
  // You'll still want to allow requests through to the static assets,
  // so we need to set up this route to ignore URLs that have a trailing ".":
  // (e.g. your javascript, CSS, and image files)
  'get /*(^.*)': 'UserController.profile'
